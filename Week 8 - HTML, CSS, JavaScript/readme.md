<h1>Lab 8: Trivia</h1>
<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
<p>Design a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to let users answer trivia questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>In index.html, add beneath “Part 1” a multiple-choice trivia question of your choosing with HTML.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>You should use an h3 heading for the text of your question.</li>
    <li>You should have one button for each of the possible answer choices. There should be at least three answer choices, of which exactly one should be correct.  </li>
  </ul>
<li>Using JavaScript, add logic so that the buttons change colors when a user clicks on them.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If a user clicks on a button with an incorrect answer, the button should turn red and text should appear beneath the question that says “Incorrect”.</li>
    <li>If a user clicks on a button with the correct answer, the button should turn green and text should appear beneath the question that says “Correct!”.</li>
  </ul>
<li>In index.html, add beneath “Part 2” a text-based free response question of your choosing with HTML.</li>
  <ul>
  <li>You should use an h3 heading for the text of your question.</li>
  <li>You should use an input field to let the user type a response.</li>
  <li>You should use a button to let the user confirm their answer.</li>
    </ul>
<li>Using JavaScript, add logic so that the text field changes color when a user confirms their answer.</li>
<ul>
<li>If the user types an incorrect answer and presses the confirmation button, the text field should turn red and text should appear beneath the question that says “Incorrect”.</li>
<li>If the user types the correct answer and presses the confirmation button, the input field should turn green and text should appear beneath the question that says “Correct!”.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
