<h1>Lab 7: Songs</h1>
<p>Write SQL queries to answer questions about a database of songs.</p>
<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
<p>For each of the following problems, you should write a single SQL query that outputs the results specified by each problem. Your response must take the form of a single SQL query, though you may nest other queries inside of your query. You should not assume anything about the ids of any particular songs or artists: your queries should be accurate even if the id of any particular song or person were different. Finally, each query should return only the data necessary to answer the question: if the problem only asks you to output the names of songs, for example, then your query should not also output each song’s tempo.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
In 1.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all songs in the database.
<ul>
  <li>Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
In 2.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all songs in increasing order of tempo.
<ul>
  <li>Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
In 3.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of the top 5 longest songs, in descending order of length.
<ul>
  <li>Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song..</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li>
In 4.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of any songs that have danceability, energy, and valence greater than 0.75.
<ul>
  <li>Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li>
In 5.sql, write a SQL query that returns the average energy of all the songs.
<ul>
  <li>Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.</li>
</ul>
</li>




<li>
In 5.sql, write a SQL query that returns the average energy of all the songs.
<ul>
  <li>Your query should output a table with a single column and a single row containing the average energy.</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li>
In 6.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of songs that are by Post Malone.
<ul>
  <li>Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.</li>
  <li>You should not make any assumptions about what Post Malone’s artist_id is.</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li>
In 7.sql, write a SQL query that returns the average energy of songs that are by Drake.
<ul>
  <li>Your query should output a table with a single column and a single row containing the average energy.</li>
  <li>You should not make any assumptions about what Drake’s artist_id is.</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li>
In 8.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of the songs that feature other artists.
<ul>
  <li>Songs that feature other artists will include “feat.” in the name of the song.</li>
   <li>Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 
</ol>
