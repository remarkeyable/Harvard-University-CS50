<h1>Lab 7: Songs</h1>
<p>Write SQL queries to answer questions about a database of songs.</p>
<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
<p>For each of the following problems, you should write a single SQL query that outputs the results specified by each problem. Your response must take the form of a single SQL query, though you may nest other queries inside of your query. You should not assume anything about the ids of any particular songs or artists: your queries should be accurate even if the id of any particular song or person were different. Finally, each query should return only the data necessary to answer the question: if the problem only asks you to output the names of songs, for example, then your query should not also output each song’s tempo.</p>

<li>
In 1.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all songs in the database.

<li>
In 2.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all songs in increasing order of tempo.

In 4.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of any songs that have danceability, energy, and valence greater than 0.75.
