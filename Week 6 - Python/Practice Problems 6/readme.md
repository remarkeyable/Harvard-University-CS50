<h1>Practice Problems Set 6</h1>
<h2>Bank</h2>
<h2>Specification</h2>
<p>In a file called bank.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with “hello”, output $0. If the greeting starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), output $20. Otherwise, output $100. Ignore any leading whitespace in the user’s greeting, and treat the user’s greeting case-insensitively.</p>
